            <p> Hi there! I'm John and I'm 10 years. Thanks for visiting my little corner profile.<br> I'm a very happy kid. I love my family and friends. I would love to become a professional Football player in future, like Cristiano Ronaldo, he 's my favorite,
                but I'm not sure yet.
                <br> I also love to play guittar and when i listen my daddy talking about the 80's Rocky bands, that sounds awesome! So maybe I could prefer be a Rocky Star instead. But, I also love martial arts, games and Technology as well. <br> Ops!
                I got confused now, so many paths to explore. Let 's just have some fun at momment and let to think about future in few yeras time.

            <p>My School is huge. It's a very big, old and baultiful building. My teatcher said the school have more than 500 years old, that is a lot of years!
                <br> We have many activities thera, from classic music to cooking classes. There are plenty space and many classrooms, a big gardem in the rear, swimming pool, music room, football pitch and a huge indoor patio for the rainning days. It
                's a great place to study.
